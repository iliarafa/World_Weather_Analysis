# World_Weather_Analysis
__________________________

This analysis initially retrieves weather data for random locations around the world. Next, based on weather data at these locations and the traveler's input on desired minimum and maximum temperatures, we create a Customer Travel Destinations Map. Finally, a travel itinerary map is produced based on four selected locations from the Destinations map.
